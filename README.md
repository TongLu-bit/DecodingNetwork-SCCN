# DecodingNetwork
This is a repository that contains codes for the Spatially Constrained and Connected Networks (SCCN) model. Specifically, it includes:
1. Matlab codes for implementing the SCCN model to extract densely altered sub-area pairs from a pair of regions ("SCCN_alg.m" and "Reshuffle_W.m")

2. A live-script (which is matlab version of Rmarkdown) for SCCN anlaysis on a synthetic data ("Toy_example.m")

Note that the optimization is non-convex and may depend on the intitialization of the algorithms.
